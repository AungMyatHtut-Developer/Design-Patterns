# Observer Design Pattern Practice Ideas

The Observer Design Pattern is great for situations where you want to update multiple dependent objects (observers) automatically when a single object's (subject's) state changes. Here are a few scenarios to practice implementing the Observer Design Pattern:

---

## 1. Weather Monitoring System
- **Requirement**: Build a weather monitoring application that tracks temperature, humidity, and pressure. Different display elements, such as a current conditions display, a statistics display, and a forecast display, should automatically update when there’s a change in the weather data.
- **Classes**:
    - `WeatherStation` (Subject): Maintains the weather data and notifies all observers when there is an update.
    - `DisplayElement` Interface (Observer): Ensures each display has a method to update itself.
    - `CurrentConditionsDisplay`, `StatisticsDisplay`, `ForecastDisplay` (Concrete Observers): Implement the `DisplayElement` and display specific weather information.
- **Goal**: Every time the weather data changes, all display elements should update accordingly without direct intervention.

## 2. Stock Market Tracker
- **Requirement**: Design a stock price tracker that updates multiple investors whenever the stock price changes. Investors can subscribe to the stocks they’re interested in and will receive updates automatically.
- **Classes**:
    - `Stock` (Subject): Represents individual stocks, each maintaining a price and notifying subscribed investors when its price changes.
    - `Investor` Interface (Observer): Has an `update` method that each concrete investor implements to receive price updates.
    - `ConcreteInvestor` (Concrete Observers): Individual investors that get notified when the price of a stock they are subscribed to changes.
- **Goal**: Allow investors to subscribe/unsubscribe to stocks they are interested in and get updates without having to query the stock price actively.

## 3. Blog Notification System
- **Requirement**: Create a blog notification system where users can subscribe to a blog. Whenever a new blog post is published, all subscribers should be notified.
- **Classes**:
    - `Blog` (Subject): Represents the blog and maintains a list of subscribers. Notifies them whenever a new post is published.
    - `Subscriber` Interface (Observer): Represents a user with an `update` method to get notifications.
    - `ConcreteSubscriber` (Concrete Observers): Individual subscribers who receive notifications when a new blog post is published.
- **Goal**: Whenever a new blog post is published, all subscribers should automatically receive a notification without having to check manually.

## 4. Traffic Signal System
- **Requirement**: Develop a traffic signal system where multiple sensors (like pedestrian crossing lights, vehicle lights) need to update whenever the main traffic light changes.
- **Classes**:
    - `TrafficLight` (Subject): Represents the main traffic light and maintains a list of dependent lights or sensors.
    - `Sensor` Interface (Observer): Represents an interface with an `update` method for dependent sensors and lights.
    - `PedestrianLight`, `VehicleLight`, `SensorDisplay` (Concrete Observers): Different types of sensors/lights that automatically update based on the state of the main traffic light.
- **Goal**: Change in the main traffic light should trigger automatic updates to all dependent sensors and lights.

## 5. News Publishing System
- **Requirement**: Build a news publishing system where readers can subscribe to different news categories (e.g., sports, politics, technology). When a new article in a subscribed category is published, only those readers who are subscribed to that category get notified.
- **Classes**:
    - `NewsPublisher` (Subject): Represents a news publisher that has different categories, and each category maintains a list of subscribers.
    - `Subscriber` Interface (Observer): Represents a subscriber who has an `update` method.
    - `ConcreteSubscriber` (Concrete Observers): Individual readers who are interested in receiving news updates for specific categories.
- **Goal**: Publishing an article in a particular category should notify only the readers who have subscribed to that category.

---

## 6. Chat Room Notification System
- **Requirement**: Create a chat room application where users in the chat room get notified every time a new message is posted in the chat.
- **Classes**:
    - `ChatRoom` (Subject): Represents the chat room and keeps a list of active users. It notifies them of any new messages.
    - `User` Interface (Observer): Has an `update` method that allows the user to receive new messages.
    - `ConcreteUser` (Concrete Observers): Each user who has joined the chat room and receives messages posted by others.
- **Goal**: Every time a new message is posted, all users in the chat room should receive it in real-time.

---

## 7. Auction System
- **Requirement**: Develop an auction system where bidders are notified of each new bid. Each bidder can watch the auction and will be notified automatically whenever there is a new highest bid.
- **Classes**:
    - `AuctionItem` (Subject): Represents the item up for auction and keeps a list of all active bidders.
    - `Bidder` Interface (Observer): Defines an `update` method for bidders to receive bid updates.
    - `ConcreteBidder` (Concrete Observers): Each bidder who has registered for the auction and receives bid notifications.
- **Goal**: When a new bid is placed, all bidders get notified immediately.

---

Each of these scenarios offers practice in applying the Observer Pattern for different use cases, from simple notifications (like a weather system) to more interactive setups (like a chat room or auction). Choose one to implement, set up classes, interfaces, and methods to simulate the behavior, and observe how dependent observers respond to changes in the subject.
